Comments:
1. We  need to standardize NP material and counting denotions
2 Radiation types: p, gamma, e,  c12, etc
  Energy Spectrum : BP  (irradiotn in the proximity of Bregg peak (for heavy charged paricles))
                    SOBP (irradition in the region of spread out Bredd peak)  
                    BPO ( outside/before breag peak reggion)   
                    140kV, 6MV, and so on (for gamma sources), // we may need even more coarse classification like  just "kV" or "MV"
                    Co60 and so on for the source type
3. Units of concentration are iether mg/l or mM
